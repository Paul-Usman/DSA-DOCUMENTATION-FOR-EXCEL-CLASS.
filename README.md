## Project Overview.
The aim of this project is to use Pivot Tables to generate and answer different questions. From the data collected we were able to show the highest revenue by models. By using pivot tables we were able to connect the dashboard to the various pivot tables using slicers.

### Data Sources
 The data used for this class was shared in class in an excel file name **‘Pivot Table.xlsx’**

#### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial stage of data cleaning and preparation , we perform the following functions

- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing variables
- Data Cleaning and formatting
  ## Explorative Data Analysis
 This involves exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as:

- What is the sum of revenue by region?
- What is the sum of unit sold by region?
- What is the sum of unit sold by region?
- What are the top markets in terms of revenue?
- What are the revenue generated in two Years?

## Data Analysis
This is where we explored the pivot table fields and generated different pivot tables to answer the questions above. With just a few clicks and using the X and Y axis we were able to achieve this. There are four arguments in the Pivot Table field which are; **filters**, **column**, **rows** and **values**.
The dashboard was created by doing the following:
1. Creating a graph from our pivot table, usinig the insert menu.
2. Formatting the graph leaving only the data label.
3. Renaming the table connected to the pivot table to Table1.
4. Inserting slicers 
5. Making connections with the dashboard and pivot tables.
6. Results/Findings
7. From the analysis, we were able to generate the following:

## Result/Findings
- Find out the total revenue for each region and the sum total
- The sum of units sold by each regions
- Top markets in terms of revenue
- Revenue by months and years


### Recommendations

Using this report, the company or the conglomerate should make wise decisions on whose line of business or model to invest more money on so as to get adequate return of investment.

#### Limitations 
 The locations of this companies will determine how much they will make. The customers/consumers should be readily available to purchase these problems.
